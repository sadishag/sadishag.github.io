        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Sadisha Galappatti, a passionate Full Stack/Cloud Developer
          with a comprehensive skill set that spans the entire software
          engineering stack and lifecycle. I thrive on turning innovative ideas
          into robust, scalable solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          From Toronto Canada, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of
          technology for 6 years. My journey began with a fascination for coding
          in university, leading me to explore various aspects of software
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Full Stack Developer, I specialize in bridging the gap between
          front-end and back-end technologies. I've honed my skills in crafting
          seamless user experiences using React on the front end, and building
          powerful, scalable APIs with NodeJS on the back end.
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise extends into cloud engineering, where I've leveraged
          technologies like Terraform to architect and deploy robust, scalable
          infrastructure in Azure professionally and GCP personally. From
          provisioning resources to automating deployment pipelines, I thrive on
          optimizing cloud solutions for efficiency and performance.
