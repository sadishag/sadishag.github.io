        <p>
          Hello, I'm Sadisha Galappatti, a passionate Full Stack/Cloud Developer
          with a comprehensive skill set that spans the entire software
          engineering stack and lifecycle. I turn innovative ideas into robust,
          scalable solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've immersed myself in the dynamic Toronto tech scene for six years.
          My journey began with a fascination for coding, which i explored in
          university. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in various
          aspects of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Full Stack Developer, I specialize in bridging the gap between
          front end and back end technologies. I excel at crafting seamless user
          experiences with React on the front end, and building powerful,
          scalable APIs with NodeJS on the back end.
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise extends into cloud engineering, where I've leveraged
          technologies like Terraform to design and deploy resilient
          infrastructure in Azure professionally and GCP personally. From
          provisioning resources to automating deployment pipelines, I thrive on
          optimizing cloud solutions for efficiency and performance.
